# 2. Add to Cart

Since we currently don't have any products within our Moltin inventory, we'll go ahead and add a custom item to the Cart.

Custom cart items are a great solution, if you manage your inventory outside of Moltin, and wish to slowly migrate your data.

Custom items are also perfect when dealing with **taxes** and **shipping** charges.‌

### Add to Cart <a id="add-to-cart"></a>

‌

Let's go ahead and add a `custom_item` to the Cart. We'll be using the same cart reference `abc` as in the [previous step](https://app.gitbook.com/@moltin/s/guides/your-first-api-request/1.-authentication).

Replace `XXXX` below with your `access_token`.

```text
curl -X POST https://api.moltin.com/v2/carts/abc/items \     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \     -d $'{      "data": {        "type": "custom_item",        "name": "T-Shirt",        "sku": "tshirt-001",        "description": "A Moltin branded T-shirt",        "quantity": 1,        "price": {          "amount": 10000        }      }    }'
```

‌

We can very easily add another `custom_item` to the Cart.

```text
curl -X POST https://api.moltin.com/v2/carts/abc/items \     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \     -d $'{      "data": {        "type": "custom_item",        "name": "Jeans",        "sku": "jeans-orange-001",        "description": "Moltin branded jeans",        "quantity": 1,        "price": {          "amount": 12500        }      }    }'
```

‌

Both of these requests will respond with the current cart items, including useful data such as `display_price` for each item, which provides helpful formatted currencies for items in the cart.‌

Now we have items in the cart, in the next lesson we will convert the Cart to an unpaid Order using the `/checkout` endpoint.[
