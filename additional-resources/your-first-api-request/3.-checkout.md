# 3. Checkout

Great! We have a Cart with the reference `abc` which includes our T-Shirt as a `custom_item`. We'll now take the Cart and convert it to an Order using the [Checkout API](https://docs.moltin.com/carts-and-checkout/checkout).‌

### Checkout a Cart <a id="checkout-a-cart"></a>

You can Checkout a Cart using an existing Customer ID or an object including the customer name and email. In the example below, we'll provide a name and an email, as we have no customers yet 😢.

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll need to re-authenticate when the `access_token` expires.‌
{% endhint %}

Along with the customers information, we must also provide the billing and shipping information. Using cURL we can send the following request:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Replace `XXXX` below with your `access_token.`
{% endhint %}

```bash
‌curl -X POST https://api.moltin.com/v2/carts/abc/checkout \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{
		"data": {
			"customer": {
				"email": "jamie.barton@moltin.com",
				"name": "Jamie Barton"
			},
			"billing_address": {
				"first_name": "Jamie",
				"last_name": "Barton",
				"company_name": "Moltin",
				"line_1": "British India House",
				"postcode": "NE1 6UF",
				"county": "Tyne & Wear",
				"country": "UK"
			},
			"shipping_address": {
				"first_name": "Jamie",
				"last_name": "Barton",
				"line_1": "British India House",
				"postcode": "NE1 6UF",
				"county": "Tyne & Wear",
				"country": "UK"
			}
		}
     }'
```

When the request is complete, you'll receive a `201 CREATED` response similar below:

```bash
‌{
	"data": {
		"type": "order",
		"id": "a4a83c8b-c71d-4eec-8f0a-30c562bd5f3e",

				"without_tax": {
					"amount": 1998,
					"currency": "USD",
					"formatted": "$19.98"
				}
			},
			"timestamps": {

				"updated_at": "2018-10-12T15:02:37Z"
			}
		},
		"relationships": {
			"items": {
				"data": [
					{
						"type": "item",
						"id": "e2f7aa51-a96a-4d84-b0cb-f8ec35e94f2f"

				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

👆 Congratulations. This is your first Order.‌

### Inspecting the Order <a id="inspecting-the-order"></a>

You can see in the Order object above we received a few values that make paying for an Order really easy.

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `id` | This is the ID for the newly created order. You'll need this to get the order again in the future or when paying for an order. |
| `status` | This will be either **`complete`** or **`incomplete`**. Useless when grouping orders in your own UI to your customers when they're logged in. |
| `payment` | An order will be immediately unpaid, but once you move onto paying for an order, this can be: **`authorized`**, **`paid`** or **`refunded`**. |
| `shipping` | This will be either **`fulfilled`** or **`unfulfilled`**. |
| `meta` | This object contains useful metadata for your order including a formatted [order total](https://www.moltin.com/developer/concepts/how-to-calculate-cart-and-order-totals) for your cart, along with when the cart was created. |
| `relationships` | This object will contain the IDs for related objects, including the [Order Items](https://docs.moltin.com/orders-and-customers/orders/order-items) and the [Customer](https://docs.moltin.com/orders-and-customers/customers#the-customer-object), if you provided one during Checkout. |

‌

### Clean up your Cart <a id="clean-up-your-cart"></a>

Once a Cart is converted to an Order, the Cart will exist for another 7 days, unless you touch it again. You can send a request to `DELETE` the Cart, if you no longer require the items inside.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Replace `XXXX` below with your `access_token.`
{% endhint %}

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.moltin.com/v2/carts/abc \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX"
```
