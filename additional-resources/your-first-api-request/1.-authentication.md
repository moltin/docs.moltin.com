# 1. Authentication

Requests to Moltin require an `Authorization` header containing your `Bearer` token. There are two token types; `implicit` and `client_credentials`. See [Authentication](https://docs.moltin.com/basics/authentication) for more details.

This guide will use the implicit grant type. This grant type can be thought of as READ ONLY and most commonly used client side.

### Get your API keys

Head to the [Moltin Dashboard](https://dashboard.moltin.com), sign in, select your project and make a copy of your `client_id`.

### Get an access token

Using the `client_id`, we can now make our very first API request. Inside your Terminal or command-line equivalent, make the following request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moltin.com/oauth/access_token \
     -d "client_id=XXXX" \
     -d "grant_type=implicit"
```

A successful request will respond with something similar to:

```javascript
{
  "expires": 1537779121,
  "identifier": "implicit",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "0e82127a8d9c20abb3d6e48561cbfe81448956ab",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Congratulations! 🙌

Now you'll want to make a copy of your `access_token`. This is your implicit `Bearer` token that is required for future requests.

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll need to re-authenticate when the `access_token` expires.
{% endhint %}

### Make a request with your access token

Let's go ahead and request a new Cart. We'll use the unique reference `abc` for the Cart. We'll need this when requesting the items, adding items and checking out.

{% hint style="warning" %}
 Replace `XXXX` below with your `access_token` from above.
{% endhint %}

Inside your command-line, run the following cURL request:

```bash
curl https://api.moltin.com/v2/carts/abc \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX"
```

You'll receive a response similar to:

```javascript
{
  "data":{
    "id":"a054e10e-5fb7-4a76-a496-c59638d45939",
    "type":"cart",
    "links":{
      "self":"https://api.moltin.com/carts/a054e10e-5fb7-4a76-a496-c59638d45939"
    },
    "meta":{
      "display_price":{
        "with_tax":{
          "amount":0,
          "currency":"",
          "formatted":"0"
        },
        "without_tax":{
          "amount":0,
          "currency":"",
          "formatted":"0"
        }
      },
      "timestamps":{
        "created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "updated_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now that we have successfully authenticated and retrieved a Cart, in the next lesson we will add a custom item to the Cart.
