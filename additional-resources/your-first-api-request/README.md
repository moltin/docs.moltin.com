# Your First API Request

Welcome! This is a great place to get started, if you're new to Moltin.

The guides below use the command line to make requests via cURL, but you could as easily use a [supported SDK](https://www.moltin.com/developer/sdks).

You will learn how to successfully authenticate, create a Cart, add to Cart, checkout and pay for an order.
