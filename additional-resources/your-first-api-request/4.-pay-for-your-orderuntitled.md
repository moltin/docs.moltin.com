# 4. Pay for your order

Now that we have an unpaid order, we can move onto using the Payments API.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Before we can use the Payments API, we must first configure a payment gateway.‌
{% endhint %}

### Payment Gateways <a id="payment-gateways"></a>

Right now Moltin provides native payment functionality for the following providers:‌

* ​[Stripe](https://app.gitbook.com/@moltin/s/api/payments/gateways/configure-stripe)​
* ​[Braintree](https://app.gitbook.com/@moltin/s/api/payments/gateways/configure-braintree)​
* ​[CardConnect](https://app.gitbook.com/@moltin/s/api/payments/gateways/configure-cardconnect)​
* ​[Adyen](https://app.gitbook.com/@moltin/s/api/payments/gateways/configure-adyen)​

You will want to use the Manual Gateway if your gateway isn't listed above, you can learn how to use that [here](https://app.gitbook.com/@moltin/s/guides/guides/payment/implement-own-payment-gateway).‌

### Configure your gateway <a id="configure-your-gateway"></a>

In this example we will be using Stripe. If you want to follow along, login or sign up to Stripe and head to [Developers &gt; API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys) and make a copy of your **secret key**.‌

Next we'll need to tell Moltin the Stripe secret key, but we'll need a `client_credentials` token to do that.‌

You'll need your `client_id` and `client_secret` from the [Moltin Dashboard](https://dashboard.moltin.com/) to do this.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.moltin.com/oauth/access_token \
     -d "client_id=XXXX" \
     -d "client_secret=XXXX" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials"‌
```

Once completed you will receive your `access_token`.

```bash
‌{
  "expires": 1537779121,
  "identifier": "implicit",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "9z12127b8d9e20abb3d6e48561cbfe81448956pl",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

We can now configure the [Stripe gateway](https://docs.moltin.com/payments/gateways/configure-stripe) using the Moltin API. _You may also configure payment gateways via the Moltin Dashboard._

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will need to replace `XXXX` with your `access_token` and Stripe secret key below.
{% endhint %}

```bash
‌curl -X PUT https://api.moltin.com/v2/gateways/stripe \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d $'{
       "data": {
         "enabled": true,
         "login": "XXXX"
       }
     }'
```

### Make a payment <a id="make-a-payment"></a>

We now have everything we need to pay for our Order. 🎉‌

Payments are handled via token and sources. These are secure tokens that permit `authorize`/`capture` on your card. Stripe provide many tools to generate tokens, including [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/reference) and [Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout).‌

Stripe also provides a variety of tokens you can use during test/development environments and in the example below, we will use the `tok_visa` to simulate a successful VISA payment.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Replace XXXX with your access\_token and replace `:orderId` with your unpaid order ID we created in the [previous step](https://app.gitbook.com/@moltin/s/guides/your-first-api-request/3.-checkout#checkout-a-cart).
{% endhint %}

```bash
‌curl -X POST https://api.moltin.com/v2/orders/:orderId/payments \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer XXXX" \
     -d $'{
        "data": {
          "gateway": "stripe",
          "method": "purchase",
          "payment": "tok_visa"
        }
      }'
```

**Congratulations!** 🎉 You have now successfully paid for your unpaid order.[
